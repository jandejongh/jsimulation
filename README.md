# jsimulation
Discrete-Event Simulation in Java

A small collection of Java packages specifying and implementing discrete-event simulation, including support for events, actions and event lists, and for event-list scheduling and processing.

Actually part of the jqueues repository (https://github.com/jandejongh/jqueues) yet split off so queues can be connected to (alternative) event-list implementations.

### Dependencies

None.

### Documentation

Both jsimulation and jqueues have extensive javadoc comments; a 'Guided Tour' is on its way.
